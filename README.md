## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Responsive
- Basic use of HTML and CSS
- A little bit of time and work


### What I learned
I learened HTML an CSS by watching videos on youtube well most of as do same but i didn't use this knowledge to make projects and that is why i don't have the confidence to build projects mostly i watched tutorials to build projects but coding not work that way unless you code by your on.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

Use of br tags to break line

<h2>Improve your front-end <br>skills by building projects</h2>


<p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend <br> Mentor and take your coding skils to <br>the next level</p>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

.container{
    width: 320px;
    height: 497px;
    margin: auto;
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 1rem;
    box-shadow: 1 1 1.5px;
    text-align: center;

}

.container img{
    width: 90%;
    border-radius: 0.7rem;
    margin-top: 1rem;
}
```


### Continued development
I need to work on my position skills and and also CSS units they are important and media querys because i am still not completely understand it.
